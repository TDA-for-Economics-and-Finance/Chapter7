Chapter 7 introdues Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper (TDABM) and has comparisons with the Mapper algorithm of Singh et al. (2007). We use artificial data to make the comparisons. You may find all of the relevant code within the .ipynb file

To see a practical application of TDABM, see Chapter 8
